/**
 * EXERCISE 6
 * ======================================================
 * @task
 * Make sure the BankAccount type is imported
 * Create the getClientWithNoMoney() function that follows:
 * * Takes an array of bank account objects
 * * Returns
 * * * An array of account holders' names that have no money on their balance if there are some (balance === 0)
 * * * Else returns an empty array
 * The for loop must be used
 * The function must be exported
 * Example: getClientWithNoMoney(bankAccounts) => ['Kevin', 'Jon']
 */

import { BankAccount } from './e5';

export function getClientWithNoMoney(array) {
  // Your code goes here...
}

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-6"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
