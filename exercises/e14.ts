/**
 * EXERCISE 14
 * ======================================================
 * @task
 * Make sure the BankAccount type is imported
 * Create the getClientsWithWrongBalance() function that follows:
 * * Takes an array of bank account objects as the argument
 * * Returns an array of bank accounts that have wrong balance value.
 * * The balance value is supposed to equal the difference of all deposits and all withdrawals, otherwise it's wrong
 * The for loop must be used
 * The function must be exported
 * Example: getClientsWithWrongBalance(bankAccounts) => [{ name: 'Name1', balance: 32, ... }, { name: 'Name2', balance: 3523, ... }]
 */

import { BankAccount } from './e5';

export function getClientsWithWrongBalance(arr) {
  // Your code goes here...
}

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-14"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
