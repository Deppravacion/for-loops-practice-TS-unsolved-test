## GETTING STARTED

- Clone this repository.
- Create a new repository in your Github account. Set it to be a public repo. Copy the new repo SSH path.
- Open the cloned repo project in your favorite IDE. Start a terminal session.
- Update/change the remote origin path with to the new SSH path **OR** add a new path (f.i "solved" or "destination"). [Github's git remote actions docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories).
- Push the main/master branch to the new repository.
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies and packages.
- Start solving the exercises, following the "HOW IT WORKS" section.

## HOW IT WORKS

- The repo has the "exercises" folder with 20 exercise files (e1.js, e2.js, ... etc). Each file includes the task description, a function declared, data imported if required, and a placeholder for your code.
- Descriptions for some exercises are located in /exercise-info/ folder
- Open e1.js file and start writing functions' code in the "Your code goes here..." placeholder to achieve the goals described.
- Most of the functions, type or interfaces are asked to be exported or imported.
  - to export an entity use the export keyword before the entity declaration.
  - to import an entity use the import keyword before the entity declaration.
    Examples:

```JS
// Exporting a function, a type or an interface:
export function someFunc(args) {
  return args;
};
export type someType = { num1: number };
export interface someInterface = { name: string };

// Importing an exported entity by entity names from a source file
import { someFunc, someType, someInterface } from './sourceFile';
```

- ðŸ”´ **You can use FOR LOOPS ONLY to iterate through data array/nested arrays. Other types of iterating not allowed (.filter, .find, .map, .reduce, etc...), you can still use `for of` `for in` as you wish and we encourage you to do so**
- ðŸ”´ **The ONLY array method you can use is `Array.push()`. Other array methods are NOT allowed.**
- ðŸ”´ **Spread/rest operators are NOT allowed.**
- ðŸ”´ **Do NOT declare other functions inside the given function code block. All the code outside of the given function will be commented out when grading.**
- Once you are done, run the test command `npm run test-1` in the command line, where "1" is the current exercise number. This will start the test environment and show the passed and failed tests for the current code you have written.
- If the test results have all tests passed (no red comments), consider it to be finished successfully, then switch to the next exercise file.
- If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function. That's an acceptance criteria!
- If you have any TypeScript notifications/problems, refactor the code until you have 0 of them. That's an acceptance criteria!
- Please, don't switch to the next exercise file until the current one is finished successfully.
- Please, don't switch to the next part file until the current part ALL exercises are solved successfully.
- The goal is to write proper code for every exercise file, pass ALL tests successfully, have 0 TypeScript notifications/problems and 0 elements of type 'Any'
- Once you have finished ALL files you can run ALL tests to test yourself with `npm run test-all`

### CAUTION

Please, do **NOT** change or update:

- Functions' arguments or their names.
- Files in the "data" folder.
- Files in the "test" folder.

You can only write your code in the "Your code goes here..." placeholder in each exercise file.

Changing the files listed above may cause tests failure.
Please, do not add/commit any repo changes before you finish ALL the exercises and pass All test.
If you haven't added, committed any changes you can always restore those file's initial state with `git restore <fileName>` command.

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- ALL the requirements from this file and tasks' descriptions must be met.
- There must be 0 TypeScript notifications
- There must be 0 items of type ANY. All functions arguments types MUST be annotated.
- The assignment must be submitted as the github repo

**_Note_** The assignments might still be rejected id the instructor thinks that you might put some more work in refactoring the code for efficiency/code smell reasons, even if all the acceptance criteria is met.

### HOW TO SUBMIT

- Make sure all the tests pass with `npm run test-all`.
- If not, refactor your code to have all tests passed. You can run `npm run test-all` again, once you think you have fixed it to see the results.
- Commit and push the changes to your repository (the one you have created on step 2 of GETTING STARTED).
- Create a txt file, put the link (URL) of the repository into it, and submit through the form on the exercise page in devslopes course.
